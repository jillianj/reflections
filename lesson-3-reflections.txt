    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
    local?
    
      When you are working with a group or creating an open source project.
    
    Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    
      So you will get updated files at the time you need them during your development.

    Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
    use one instead of another?
    
    Forks clone a repository that is on github to your github account.
    Clones copy a repository on your local directory or from git hub to your computer.
    Branches allow space to work on additional features or versions without changing the master branch until the feature or version is ready to be committed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To use as a backup.
