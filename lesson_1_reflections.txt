How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it so much easier! Love it!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Help tremendously with debgging issues!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Having a purpose behind each file version and better organization/understanding around changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google docs isn't made for programmers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To see where and when changes were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Having a backup to refer to is priceless!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   To sharpen my programming skills.
